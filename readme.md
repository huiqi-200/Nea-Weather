# Sample code to get a date range of data from data.gov.sg


For the particular API, there was only an option to select for a given date range.  
A list was used and looped over to get 1 json for a given day, which will be saved in a folder "raw"  

A transformation to get the maximum value (rainfall) for a given hour at a given station_id was used
